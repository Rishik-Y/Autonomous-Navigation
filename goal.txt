For More Complex Roads: To handle intersections,
 you would need a more advanced approach. This would involve "skeletonizing" the road image (thinning it to a 1-pixel wide line)
 and then properly detecting junctions to build a graph, 
 which brings you back full circle to something like networkx, but generated from an image!
 Libraries like OpenCV or scikit-image are perfect for these tasks.
